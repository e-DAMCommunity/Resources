## Technologies Involved 

-  **_HTML, CSS, Javascript_** are the main three pillars of _Web Development_. And there are  many Open-Source Frameworks and Plugins available for the development.
-  Frameworks helps developers with already custom built components to their code.
- There are some **_CSS_** frameworks  like : 
	* **Tailwind CSS** - This CSS Framework helps in providing _utility classes_ for your code where styling is needed. One of the key benefits of Tailwind is that it allows developers to build custom designs without having to write custom CSS.
	* **Bootstrap** - Bootstrap is a more feature-complete framework, with a larger set of predefined styles and UI components. And easier to build responsive layouts.
	
- And Javascript has many frameworks & libraries, but while learning Frontend we come across : 
	* **jQuery** - For DOM (Document-Object Model) Manipulations.
	* **React.js** - This JS Library often used for building Single-page applications and UI components can be reusable.
	* **Angular** - Like React, Angular is also a JS Framework for Single-page Apps and helps in creating reusable UI Components. It uses a template-based syntax.
	* **Vue.js** - Like React and Angular, Vue allows developers to create reusable UI components. It uses a template-based syntax, similar to Angular, which means that the UI is defined in HTML.
	and more...
	
**NOTE** : Choose one framework and try to learn about it maximum. Then if you're interested you can go with others too.

**NOTE :** Project-based learning is best learning. So, learn while doing projects. When you're starting you can take reference to others work. But later on try yourself and enhance yourself.

### <u>*Day 16-20*</u>
As of now you have some knowledge of HTML, CSS. Start building ***projects***. Initially you can take video references but later try to make your own projects and show case them with your fellow developers and take inputs from them and try to implement them by your next projects.

***Some HTML & CSS Projects Ideas:*** 
1. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/">Web Design Certification - freecodecamp.org</a> - This is a completly free certification course. Here, you needed to build 5 projects each by learning them. Finally you will receive a certificate by completing 5 projects.
2. <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontendmentor.io</a> - Provides you complete design pack of the website you have to built. Try to convert design to your development code and submit to them.
3. Try to **clone some websites**, like :
	- A basic landing page: This could include a header, a hero image or banner, some sections to highlight features or products, and a footer. You could use HTML to structure the content and CSS to style it. 
	- A portfolio website: This could showcase your work and projects, and include an about section, a contact form, and links to your social media profiles. You could use HTML to structure the content and CSS to style it and add transitions and animations.

### <u>*Day 21-35*</u>
Now, you have basic understanding of how to structure elements in web browser and styling them using HTML & CSS. Now it's time for Javascript (JS).

***Javascript*** - JavaScript is an object-oriented language that is commonly used in web development to create dynamic and interactive websites. It is often used alongside HTML and CSS to build web pages and web applications. 

Javascript is very popular programming language that it is used in various domains. And many developers fav language.

<img width="320px" height="350px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Javascript-shield.svg" alt="css">

**Must Known** :
- Basic syntax and control structures: This includes understanding how to write basic JavaScript code and how to use control structures such as loops and conditional statements.
- Document Object Model (DOM): The DOM is a tree-like structure that represents the structure of a web page. JavaScript allows you to manipulate the DOM to add, delete, and modify elements on a web page. &nbsp;<a href="https://jquery.com">*jQuery*</a> - makes it easier for DOM manipulations.
- Handling events: JavaScript can be used to respond to user actions such as clicking a button or hovering over an element on a web page.
- Making HTTP requests: JavaScript can be used to make HTTP requests to retrieve data from a server or to send data to a server.

**ECMAScript 6 (also known as ECMAScript 2015 or ES6) is the sixth major version of the ECMAScript language, which is the standardized version of JavaScript.**

Some of the main features of ES6 include : 
-   Arrow functions: A new syntax for defining functions that is shorter and easier to read than the traditional function keyword.
-   Classes: A new syntax for defining object-oriented classes in JavaScript.
-   Modules: A new way to organize and reuse code in JavaScript, which allows you to import and export functions and variables from one module to another.
-   Promises: A new way to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript, which makes it easier to write code that works with async/await.
-   Template literals: A new syntax for defining strings that allows you to easily include variables and expressions within a string.
-   Destructuring: A new syntax for extracting values from arrays and objects, which makes it easier to work with data structures in JavaScript.

***NOTE*** : If you are learning JavaScript, it is generally a good idea to become familiar with ES6, as it is widely used in modern web development.

***JS Frameworks*** 

**Why learning Frameworks ?** \
*A)* Learning a front-end JavaScript framework can be a valuable investment for anyone who is interested in building web applications. It can help you build better applications more efficiently, and it can also provide opportunities & professional development.

***There are many front-end JavaScript frameworks that you can use to build web applications. Some popular ones include:***

1.  React: React is a popular and powerful front-end framework developed by Facebook. It is designed to be used for building user interfaces, and it is known for its flexibility and performance.
    
2.  Angular: Angular is a full-featured front-end framework developed by Google. It provides a complete set of tools and features for building web applications, and it is a popular choice for large-scale enterprise applications.
    
3.  Vue.js: Vue.js is a lightweight and easy-to-learn front-end framework that is gaining popularity among developers. It is known for its simplicity and its ability to integrate with other libraries and frameworks.
    
4.  Ember.js: Ember.js is a front-end framework that is focused on building ambitious web applications. It provides a number of features and tools that are designed to help you build scalable and maintainable applications.

and many....

**NOTE** : Don't try to learn all frameworks at single time. Choose one framework and try to learn and do projects in it completly then move over to other based on your neccesity.

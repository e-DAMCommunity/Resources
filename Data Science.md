<h3 align="center">DataScience</h3>

## <h3> 💯 #100DaysOfDataScience </h3>
<p> This is an intitiation which is for freshers and any person who wishes to learn any technology with a roadmap, resources, practical experience, and guidence/mentorship. </p>

# Introduction to Data Science

A data scientist is typically expected to achieve mastery on below mentioned skills:  

1. Programming Skills: Data scientists must have strong programming skills in languages such as Python, R, Java, and C++.
2. Statistical Knowledge: Data scientists must have a deep understanding of statistics and probability theory.
3. Machine Learning: Data scientists must be familiar with machine learning algorithms and techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
4. Data Visualization: Data scientists must be able to visualize data in order to gain insights from it. They should be familiar with tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and D3.js.
5. Database Knowledge: Data scientists must understand how to query databases using SQL and NoSQL technologies such as MongoDB and Cassandra.
6. Communication Skills: Data scientists must be able to communicate their findings effectively to stakeholders in the organization in order to drive actionable insights from the data they analyze.

It’s natural to be overwhelmed. One can divide one’s data science learning journey into three stages

1. Data Analyst-One using existing tools to generate insights
2. Data Engineer-One creating pipelines to facilitate the use of data for the growth of the organization.
3. Data Scientist-Who entertains his curious heart by formulating new ways to understand data.

Once you complete this program, you can proudly call yourself as a data analyst. For that, this program primarily focuses on:

1. Programming Skills through Python
2. Database Knowledge through PostgreSQL
3. Data Visualization through PowerBi, and Excel.

# Prerequisites

This roadmap is aimed and designed for beginners but there are some prerequisites, regarding the mode of learning and procedure of maintaining notes. But first, you need to be aware of some [modern learning techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_dXip0J37g).

Since childhood, we were accustomed to writing notes on paper. But you cannot effectively utilize the benefits of active recall(an modern learning technique) if you still use them. Moreover, you may not know, when you may require notes to accomplish a task. And, Nowadays we have backups for everything. It is time, that our notes receive an upgrade. I recommend everyone to start using [notion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B4Yn2o3UvI). It is a great [note-taking platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj9HeT-IaEg). 

 It is mandatory for everyone to use this roadmap to practically implements what he/she is learning. This way you will be able to retain more information and train your analytical thought process.

# Guidelines

- There are links to paid and unpaid resources under each technology. It is highly recommended to go for paid resources. Since your Return on Investment is higher.
- It is recommended to use paid resources, especially for SQL and Power Bi
- It is mandatory for everyone to give 3hrs a day for 100 days to learn these technologies.
- Consistency must always be upheld.
- It is necessary for every participant to use “[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python”](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) as reference material while learning python.
- Everyone by the end of the program is expected to completely read a book called [Naked Statistics](https://zlibrary.to/pdfs/naked-statistics-stripping-the-dread-from-the-data-pdf)
- Everyone has to utilize notion as their note-taking tool.
